*DESCRIPTION*:
This project involves creating a Weather Forecast Dashboard using IDLE Python, integrating real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, and visualizing it with Matplotlib and Seaborn. It showcases how to fetch, process, and visualize real-world data in a meaningful and insightful way, using a city of choice (e.g., Mumbai).
The project begins by requesting forecast data for the next five days from OpenWeatherMap’s API. The returned data is in JSON format and contains various weather metrics like temperature, humidity, and description of weather conditions in three-hour intervals. Using Python’s requests and datetime libraries, the script extracts the relevant fields and organizes them for analysis.
The key features of this project include:
Real-time data fetching using a public API.
Temperature and humidity plots with proper labeling and time axes.
Option to change the city dynamically by updating one variable.
Saving the weather forecast into a CSV file.
Displaying visualizations on a single page dashboard.

The visualization component is implemented using Seaborn and Matplotlib. These libraries help create clean, styled plots. The first plot shows the change in temperature over the forecast period, while the second plot shows humidity variation. A third visualization combines both plots into one dashboard using a subplot layout.
The dashboard is designed for clarity, making it easy to interpret trends at a glance. For example, users can spot a drop in temperature at night or spikes in humidity during the day. The data points are also saved to a local CSV file, which can be used later for reports or advanced analysis.

The script is modular and user-friendly. By changing the city name at the top of the script (e.g., replacing "London" with "Mumbai"), the user can get forecast data for any location globally. The use of comments throughout the script ensures clarity for new learners and developers.
This project is especially useful for students and beginners who want hands-on experience in:
Working with APIs
Handling JSON data
Creating visualizations
Building data dashboards
Exporting structured data to CSV
It also demonstrates how Python can be used for automated data analysis and reporting, skills that are highly valued in the fields of data science, software engineering, and meteorology.

This Weather Forecast Dashboard project is a simple yet powerful application of Python programming. It combines real-time data acquisition with clean visual representation and serves as a great foundation for more advanced projects. Users not only learn to interact with APIs but also understand how to represent data graphically for insights. The dashboard can be extended in the future with features like real-time updates, more weather parameters, or integration with a GUI.
